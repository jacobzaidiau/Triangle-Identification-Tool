# TriangleClient

This is a Windows Forms application which displays information about triangles depending on what inputs you give. The application itself does not do any computations with the inputs you provide, but instead passes them onto a SOAP web service which returns the information which goes through to the various check boxes. There is also the ability to manually add and edit previous triangles in an MVC window within the chrome embedded framework. 

Also of interest, it is possible to scroll through previous searches as well as return to the the first or last pages.
